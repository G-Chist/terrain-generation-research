This repository contains the code used to generate and analyze noise-based terrains.

Overview:
- Generate 2D terrain heightmaps using Perlin noise and fractal functions.
- Analyze terrains by extracting features like peaks, pits, ridges, and flat zones.
- Compare synthetic terrains to real-world terrains via a “realness” score.
- Train simple models to predict realism from features.
- Export terrains to grayscale PNGs or Blender-compatible formats.
