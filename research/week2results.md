## Week 2 results

- perlin_numpy.py
  - removed min/max height
  - added coloring
    - colors the Blender object with multiple gradients depending on height
  - added dig_path
    - a function that searches for a path using DFS and a height difference threshold and applies convolutions to draw paths
    - draws a natural-looking path if post-processing (blurring) is applied
  - added terracing
    - terracing + blurring generates a traversable terrain given the right parameters
---
- open_terrain_from_png_to_csv.py + load_csv_to_blender.py
  - enables us to load a terrain from a .png height map into Blender and smoothen it with some convolutions
---
- symbolic_regression_grid.py
  - applies symbolic regression to a Perlin noise sample
    - not very productive for landscape generation
    - could be used later to discover trends in terrains
---
- other
  - found a Unity plugin designed to generate a realistic terrain using a GAN
