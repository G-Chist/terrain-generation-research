## Week 3 results

- perlin_numpy.py
  - added texturing
    - applies a granite texture to the object in Blender
  - might be slow depending on generating options
    - ~10s to generate a blank terrain
    - ~30s to generate a terrain with gradients
    - ~45s to generate a textured terrain
---
- utils.py
  - abstracts out the functions used in non-standalone files
  - added functions to generate feature maps of terrains and count features
    - can be useful to determine if a terrain is real or not
    - examples:
      - Feature counts for Perlin Noise:   {'flat': 0, 'peak': 38, 'ridge': 288, 'shoulder': 260206, 'spur': 0, 'slope': 0, 'pit': 47, 'valley': 506, 'footslope': 1059, 'hollow': 0}
      - Feature counts for Eroded Terrain: {'flat': 156, 'peak': 1564, 'ridge': 16053, 'shoulder': 178269, 'spur': 0, 'slope': 704, 'pit': 1432, 'valley': 11066, 'footslope': 52900, 'hollow': 0}
      - Feature counts for Real Terrain:   {'flat': 0, 'peak': 12314, 'ridge': 54662, 'shoulder': 124893, 'spur': 263, 'slope': 1, 'pit': 8781, 'valley': 59694, 'footslope': 1381, 'hollow': 155}

- weierstrass-mandelbrot_numpy.py
  - implements the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot function using NumPy
    - fast
---
- create_csv_feature_dataset.py
  - loads terrain features (slope, pit, peak, ridge, etc.) into a dataset
  - realness = 1.0 for real terrains, 0.5 for erosion-generated, 0.1 for Perlin noise-generated
  - 300 entries for each category
---
- fit_tree_to_csv_dataset.py
  - fits a regression tree to the terrain feature dataset
  - see regression_tree_terrain_realness.png
    - results: depth of 5, 0.0 error!
      - a terrain is real if "footslope" proportion <= 0.188
        - A footslope is a terrain feature identified when a 3x3 elevation patch has a mixed pattern of higher and lower neighbors around the center cell, but the differences are not strong or consistent enough to qualify as a shoulder, spur, ridge, or valley. It typically represents a transitional or gentle slope area, commonly found at the base of steeper terrain

- other
  - compiled a dataset of 300 Perlin noise-generated and 300 erosion-generated terrains
