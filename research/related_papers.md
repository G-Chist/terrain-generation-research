### Procedural city/road generation  
<https://cgl.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf>  
#### Can be useful for large-scale terrain realism
- The paper demonstrates how a water map, an elevation map, and a population density map can be used as inputs to apply an L-system for generating a set of roads.  
  - ![Roadmap generated from water + elevation + population density maps](images/p1i1.png)  
- By applying L-systems to an elevation map, fractals can be generated and integrated into the existing terrain, followed by blurring techniques to create more realistic large-scale terrain features.

### Learning ground traversability from simulations  
<https://idsia-robotics.github.io/files/publications/chavez-garcia2018.pdf>  
#### Can be useful for traversability estimation
- The paper demonstrates how a terrain patch can be classified as "traversable" or "not traversable" using a CNN.
  - Inputs: height map
  - Labels: a robot is simulated traversing the height map using Gazebo and ODE -> terrain is classified as "traversable" or "not traversable"
  - Output: binary classification as "traversable" or "not traversable"
  - ![CNN traversability training](images/p2i1.png)
- Both procedurally generated and real-life patches of terrain were used.
