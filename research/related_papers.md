<https://cgl.ethz.ch/Downloads/Publications/Papers/2001/p_Par01.pdf>  
#### Can be useful for large-scale terrain realism
- The paper demonstrates how a water map, an elevation map, and a population density map can be used as inputs to apply an L-system for generating a set of roads.  
  - ![Roadmap generated from water + elevation + population density maps](images/p1i1.png)  
- By applying L-systems to an elevation map, fractals can be generated and integrated into the existing terrain, followed by blurring techniques to create more realistic large-scale terrain features.

### Learning Ground Traversability from Simulations  
<https://idsia-robotics.github.io/files/publications/chavez-garcia2018.pdf>  
#### Can be useful for traversability estimation
- The paper demonstrates how a terrain patch can be classified as "traversable" or "not traversable" using a CNN.
  - Inputs: Local heightmap patches centered at the robot's position and aligned with its orientation.
  - Labels: Generated by simulating a robot (Pioneer 3-AT) in Gazebo with the ODE physics engine; if the robot successfully proceeds in the patch direction, it is labeled "traversable", otherwise "non-traversable".
  - Output: Binary classification - "traversable" vs. "not traversable".
  - ![CNN traversability training](images/p2i1.png)
- A full training pipeline is presented:
  - Procedurally generated terrains via Perlin/Simplex noise with varied features (e.g., slopes, bumps, holes, steps).
  - ~450,000 labeled samples collected over simulated trajectories.
  - Simulation is much faster and safer than real-world data collection.
- Both procedural synthetic and real-world datasets were used:
  - Real-world maps include urban areas, slopes, and mining quarries - some obtained via drones and RGB-D sensors.
  - Evaluation shows good transfer from simulation to real data.
  - ![CNN output on real-life terrain, quarry](images/p2i2.png)
- The CNN-based classifier:
  - Uses raw elevation data (no handcrafted features).
  - Includes convolutional + pooling layers followed by dense layers with softmax output.
  - Trained using Keras with Adadelta optimizer over 100 epochs.
- CNNs significantly outperform:
  - Feature-based classifiers using HOG descriptors + Random Forests.
  - Baselines that always predict the majority class.
  - ![CNN output on real-life terrain, city](images/p2i3.png)
- Application: Traversability Maps and Path Planning
  - CNN is applied densely across heightmaps for multiple orientations.
  - A turnability classifier is also trained to predict if a robot can rotate in place on a patch.
  - A graph-based planner computes Pareto-optimal paths balancing length vs. traversability.
  - Demonstrated in real-world settings (e.g., a robot navigating a grassy slope using a safe sidewalk route).
- Computational Efficiency
  - CNN inference is ~1000× faster than full physics simulation.
  - Suitable for large-scale maps: ~3200 patches/m² processed in ~350ms on CPU.
- Limitations and Future Work
  - Assumes terrain shape is the main factor - does not account for friction, material properties, or dynamics like approach speed.
  - Real-world generalization depends on how well simulation reflects real terrain diversity.
  - Suggests future models can incorporate robot self-experience or visual appearance cues for terrain classification.

### Multifractal Terrain Generation for Evaluating Autonomous Off-Road Ground Vehicles  
<https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.02172>  
#### Can be useful for small-scale rough terrain generation
- The paper applies 3D Weierstrass-Mandelbrot noise to generate rough terrains.
- Instead of using monofractal noise, multiple layers of fractal noise are combined.
- ![Multifractal vs monofractal terrain](images/p3i1.png)
- Multiple monofractal terrains (low-, mid-, high-frequency) are generated using different W-M parameters and combined via pixel-wise multiplication.
- Varying the fractal dimension D of the high-frequency terrain component affects overall terrain roughness and traversability.
- ![Multifractal terrain generation](images/p3i2.png)
- The terrains are rendered in Unreal Engine as 50.4x50.4 m landscapes for AGV testing using a simulated Clearpath Husky.
  - Resolution: 5cm / pixel

### Terrain Generation Using Genetic Algorithms  
<https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/rts/docs/GECCO_2005/Conference%20proceedings/docs/p1463.pdf>  
#### Can be useful for user-guided large-scale terrain generation with obstacles
- The paper proposes a two-stage genetic algorithm (GA) approach for 3D terrain generation using intuitive user input.
- Existing procedural and fractal techniques are fast but lack user control; sculpting is flexible but labor-intensive; GIS data is realistic but inflexible.
- This method combines the benefits of real-world terrain features and controllable layout while minimizing user effort.
- Stage 1: Terrain Silhouette Generation
  - Input: A rough 2D map with labeled regions (e.g., hills, mountains) either hand-drawn or randomly generated.
  - A GA is used to refine polygonal region boundaries into more natural silhouettes by encoding angle-based transitions.
  - ![Terrain silhouette refinement](images/p4i1.png)
  - Fitness function measures boundary smoothness, applied across multiple levels of detail (granularities).
  - Each boundary segment can have its own smoothness parameter (S) for realism.
  - Crossover and mutation operators modify angles between line segments to evolve natural shapes.
  - ![Gene crossover](images/p4i2.png)
- Stage 2: Terrain Height Field Generation
  - Input: The refined silhouette and a database of real-world or user-created terrain height field samples.
  - Each chromosome represents a sequence of transformations (e.g., rotate, scale) applied to overlapping patches of height data.
  - Patches are blended using Gaussian kernels to avoid seams.
  - Fitness function evaluates:
    - Resemblance of terrain patches to example samples.
    - Smooth transitions at region boundaries (no sharp cliffs).
    - Terrain feature characteristics like slope, frequency content, and presence of ridges/valleys.
  - Retains region-level fitness to guide crossover/mutation locally and avoid slow convergence.
  - Supports repeatability via fixed random seeds for deterministic outputs.
  - ![Visualized heightmap](images/p4i3.png)
- Advantages
  - Produces diverse, realistic terrains from limited user input.
  - Balances procedural freedom with realism from data.
  - Encodes operations rather than full heightmaps, making it scalable.
  - Designed to be implemented as a plugin or standalone tool.
- Limitations & Future Work
  - Silhouette GA limited by angular constraints - exploring more flexible edge modeling.
  - Currently uses manually labeled terrain samples - aims to automate with image processing and classification.
  - Future fitness functions could improve feature coherence and support rivers or complex transitions.

### PTRM: Perceived Terrain Realism Metric  
<https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3514244>  
#### Can be useful for realistic large-scale terrain generation
- Terrains have certain features (pits, ridges, footslopes, etc.)
- ![Terrain features](images/p5i1.png)
- Introduces a perceptual realism metric (PTRM) for terrains based on human perception.
- Input: Digital Elevation Map (DEM).
- Output: A normalized realism score (0.0–1.0) based on geomorphological features.
- Relies on geomorphons, localized landform features (e.g., valleys, ridges, hollows).
  - Geomorphons are extracted from DEMs using the GRASS GIS tool.
  - ![Geomorphon map](images/p5i2.png)
- Two large-scale user studies were conducted (2AFC design via Amazon Mechanical Turk):
  - Experiment 1: Compared real vs. synthetic terrains for perceived realism.
  - Experiment 2: Assessed terrains after CycleGAN-based feature transfer (real<->synthetic).
  - ![CycleGAN feature transfer](images/p5i3.png)
  - ![CycleGAN feature transfer, rendered](images/p5i4.png)
- Strong correlation found between certain features and perceived realism:
  - Highest positive impact: Valley (0.66), Ridge (0.64), Peak (0.44).
  - Negative impact: Slope (-0.65), Shoulder (-0.17), Flat (-0.10).
- Applications:
  - Quantitative validation of terrain realism for simulations or game environments.
  - Guiding procedural generation to include perceptually important terrain features.
- Limitations:
  - Does not account for large-scale terrain structure or visual elements like vegetation.
  - Sensitive to DEM resolution (~200m/pixel in the study).
